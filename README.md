# Bayesian_regression_and_classification

Implementing the Naive Bayes to perform classification over MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Results are compared with Bayesian Linear regression and LeNet5 architecture.
The (rudimentary) code is part of an assignment to dive in to the lowest level behind the Naive Bayes method and observe the affect of each modification and transformation over the final results.
